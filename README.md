# Advanced-DAE-on-Suicide-Data


# Suicide Data Analysis with Advanced DAE

##  About the Dataset
The dataset contains worldwide suicide records, including:
- **Country**
- **Year**
- **Gender**
- **Age Group**
- **Population**
- **Number of Suicides**
- **GDP-related data**
- **Generational groups**

This dataset helps us understand suicide trends across demographics, geography, and time.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to explore and analyze global suicide data to:
- Identify patterns across countries, genders, and age groups.
- Investigate correlations with socio-economic factors such as GDP.
- Visualize trends over time to gain insights into public health concerns.

##  Analyses Performed

### 1. Cleaning the Dataset
- Removed unnecessary columns, stripped extra spaces from column names, and ensured proper data types.
- This step prepared the dataset for accurate analysis.

### 2. Number of Suicides Committed in Each Country
- Aggregated suicides across all years for each country.
- Identified countries with the highest and lowest suicide counts.

### 3. Number of Suicides Genderwise
- Compared suicides between **male** and **female** globally.
- Highlighted clear gender-based differences.

### 4. Number of Suicides Genderwise in Each Country
- Broke down gender-based suicide numbers per country.
- Useful for country-level gender disparity analysis.

### 5. Suicides Committed by Various Age Groups
- Grouped suicides by age brackets.
- Showed which age ranges are most vulnerable.

### 6. Suicides by Age Groups in Male and Female
- Compared age-related suicide patterns between genders.
- Helped reveal whether risks differ by age and gender.

### 7. Suicides by Age Groups and Gender in Each Country
- Combined **country**, **age group**, and **gender** to give a detailed suicide profile.
- Useful for country-specific intervention planning.

### 8. Population and Suicide Rate in Yearly Basics
- Calculated yearly suicide rates relative to population.
- Showed how suicide rates change over time.

### 9. Suicide Rate in Male and Female Yearly
- Compared yearly suicide rates between genders.
- Identified trends and gaps widening/narrowing over time.

### 10. Suicide Rate Over Time in Each Country
- Long-term visualization of suicide rate trends for each country.
- Allowed country-specific comparisons over decades.

### 11. GDP Evaluation of Each Country Yearly Basis
- Studied relation between **GDP** and **suicides** per country.
- Tested the hypothesis that economic factors may influence suicide trends.

### 12. Evaluation of GDP of Albania Throughout the Period
- Focused on **Albania** as a case study.
- Examined GDP-suicide relationship across the years.

### 13. Generation Evaluation
- Analyzed suicides across generational cohorts (e.g., Boomers, Gen X, Millennials).
- Helped identify generational differences in suicide patterns.

### 14. Pairplot Through Age Group
- Created pairplots of variables across age groups.
- Visualized relationships between demographic and socio-economic factors.
