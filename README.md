# Suicide Data Analysis with Advanced DAE

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains worldwide suicide records, including country, year, gender, age group, population, number of suicides, GDP-related information, and generational groups. This dataset provides an opportunity to explore global suicide trends across different demographics, time periods, and socio-economic conditions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the suicide dataset to identify patterns across countries, genders, and age groups, as well as to investigate correlations with GDP and visualize long-term trends. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into global public health concerns related to suicide.

## Analyses Performed

### Cleaning the Dataset
The dataset was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns, stripping extra spaces from column names, and converting columns into appropriate data types. This step was crucial to ensure that the analysis was consistent and accurate.

### Number of Suicides Committed in Each Country
I analyzed the total number of suicides across different countries to identify which nations had the highest and lowest suicide counts. This gave a clear picture of the global distribution of suicide numbers.

### Number of Suicides Genderwise
The dataset was explored to compare suicide numbers between males and females. This revealed significant gender differences in suicide rates worldwide.  


### Number of Suicides Genderwise in Each Country
Next, I broke down the gender distribution of suicides within each country. This analysis helped highlight countries with the widest gender disparities in suicide rates.

### Suicides Committed by Various Age Groups
The dataset was grouped into age brackets to determine which age ranges were most vulnerable to suicide. This step showed distinct differences between younger and older populations.  


### Suicides by Age Groups in Male and Female
Further analysis compared male and female suicide counts within each age group. This gave insights into whether specific age ranges were more at risk for one gender compared to the other.

### Suicides by Age Groups and Gender in Each Country
By combining country, age group, and gender, I created a more detailed suicide profile for each nation. This deeper analysis was particularly useful for identifying country-specific patterns.

### Population and Suicide Rate in Yearly Basics
I calculated yearly suicide rates relative to population size. This allowed me to observe how suicide rates changed annually on a global scale.

### Suicide Rate in Male and Female Yearly
The yearly suicide rates were further broken down by gender. This revealed long-term patterns and whether the gap between male and female suicides has increased or decreased over time.

### Suicide Rate Over Time in Each Country
To understand country-specific trends, I visualized how suicide rates evolved over the years for individual nations. This provided valuable comparisons between countries.

### GDP Evaluation of Each Country Yearly Basis
I explored the relationship between GDP and suicide numbers on a yearly basis for each country. This analysis aimed to investigate whether economic prosperity (or lack thereof) correlated with suicide rates.  


### Evaluation of GDP of Albania Throughout the Period
As a case study, I analyzed Albaniaâ€™s GDP over time alongside suicide rates. This provided a focused example of how economic factors may impact suicide trends in a single country.

### Generation Evaluation
The dataset also included generational cohorts such as Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials. I analyzed suicides across these groups to understand how generational differences affected suicide patterns.

### Pairplot Through Age Group
Finally, I created pairplots to visualize relationships between age groups and other variables. This provided a more visual and multi-dimensional perspective on the data.
